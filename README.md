Program:         AstroData

Description:  A Forms application that will receive data input and display
              the data in a list box, with options to sort the data, and search
              for a specific value based on user input. There will also be buttons
              for a sequential search, and four mathematical operations that will
              show the user the mid-extreme, mode, average, and range of the data.
